# Ingress

The load balancing provided by the `Service` resource in Kubernetes follows a basic round-robin method. However, users were accustomed to more advanced load balancing features. Additionally, due to the cloud provider's pricing structure—charging for each IP address—there was a need to mimic the behavior of the old load balancer while minimizing costs.

### Missing Features in the Service Load Balancer

The Service-based load balancer lacked several key enterprise-level features, including:

1. **Sticky Sessions**  
   Ensure that requests from the same client are consistently routed to the same server, essential for session persistence.

2. **TLS-based Load Balancing**  
   Handling Transport Layer Security (TLS) directly at the load balancer to terminate and distribute secure traffic efficiently.

3. **Path-based Load Balancing**  
   Routing traffic based on specific URL paths, allowing for different backends to handle different parts of an application.

4. **Host/Domain-based Load Balancing**  
   Allowing traffic routing based on the requested host or domain, supporting multi-tenant environments or different services under one umbrella.

5. **Ratio-based Load Balancing**  
   Distributing traffic according to predefined weightings, sending a higher or lower proportion of traffic to certain backends.

### Why Ingress Was Needed

The basic `Service` load balancer did not meet the needs of enterprise-level workloads. Kubernetes addressed this by introducing **Ingress**, which enables users to define HTTP and HTTPS routing rules. To work with Ingress, third-party companies created Ingress Controllers like **Nginx** and **Traefik**. 

When an **Ingress** resource is created, an Ingress Controller must monitor it to enforce the specified routing rules. These controllers are essentially a combination of a **load balancer** and an **API gateway**.

### How Ingress Solves the Problem

Kubernetes came up with an architecture where users create Ingress resources, while external load balancer providers (e.g., Nginx, Traefik) develop Ingress Controllers to handle the traffic routing as per the defined rules. This architecture provides:

- **Advanced routing capabilities**
- **TLS termination support**
- **Path and domain-based routing**
- **Scalability and flexibility with third-party controllers**

Ingress solved many of the limitations associated with the basic `Service` load balancing, enabling a more robust, enterprise-level solution without incurring additional costs for IP addresses.
