# Ingress

the load balacing that `service` provides is basic round robin method , and people were used to a more complex form of load balancer , we need basic behaviour like the old load balacner beacuse cloud provider charges for eacah ip address . 

Theese things were missing in the load balacner :
1. Sticky sessions
2. TLS based load balcning
3. Path based load balcning 
4. Host/Domain based load balancing 
5. Ration Based load balancing 

Service was not giving enterprise level support , Ingress solved the following problem , Allow users to create resource called ingress and the other 3rd party created ingress controller , when you create ingress , there has to be controller to watch this ingress , 3rd party wrote controller for them ( ngnix , traffic etc ) . the kubernets came up with a architecture , user will create ingress , load balncer companies wrote the controller . ingress controller is a load balcncer + api gateway .
