# RBAC in Kubernetes

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes is implemented through the following key components:

1. **Service Accounts / Users**  
   Represents the entities that can interact with the Kubernetes API.

2. **Roles / Cluster Roles**  
   Defines the permissions for a particular namespace (Role) or across the entire cluster (ClusterRole).

3. **Role Binding / Cluster Role Binding**  
   Associates Roles or ClusterRoles to users, groups, or service accounts to grant them permissions.

Kubernetes itself does not handle user management directly. It offloads user creation to identity providers. The API server functions as an OAuth server for authentication purposes. If you are using a managed platform like EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), user management can be offloaded to **IAM users**.
