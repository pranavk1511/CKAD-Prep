# Kubernetes Deployment

## Difference Between Container, Pod, and Deployment

- **Container**: 
  - A container is how you run a **Docker image**. It is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient software environment that includes the application code and its dependencies.
  
- **Pod**: 
  - A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes and is a **Kubernetes object**. It defines how the container should be run and can host one or more containers. 
  - If a Pod contains multiple containers, those containers can share resources like storage and networking. Pods are typically created using YAML definition files.
  
- **Deployment**: 
  - A Deployment is a higher-level abstraction in Kubernetes that ensures **autoscaling** and **autohealing**. 
  - When you create a Deployment, it automatically creates a **ReplicaSet**, and the ReplicaSet is responsible for maintaining the desired number of Pod replicas.
  - Deployments manage rolling updates, allowing you to update your applications without downtime.

### Why Use a Deployment Instead of a Pod?
It is **advised not to create Pods directly**. Instead, use a Deployment resource. Inside the Deployment definition, you can specify how many replicas (Pods) you want. The ReplicaSet ensures that the correct number of Pods is always running.

- **Deployment** → creates a **ReplicaSet** → which creates and manages **Pods**.

### Controller in Kubernetes
Kubernetes has a set of **controllers** that ensure the actual state of the system matches the desired state defined in the YAML configurations. There are default controllers in Kubernetes, and you can also define custom controllers.

- **ReplicaSet**: This is the controller responsible for maintaining the specified number of Pod replicas. It also handles the **auto-healing** and **autoscaling** of Pods, ensuring high availability.

### Useful Kubernetes Commands

List all resources in the current namespace:
```bash
kubectl get all
```

To list all resources across all namespaces, use the -A flag:
```bash
kubectl get all -A
```

A Deployment is a key abstraction in Kubernetes, making it easier to manage Pods at scale with autoscaling, autohealing, and rolling update features. By using Deployments, you ensure that your applications are robust, scalable, and self-healing in a dynamic environment.
