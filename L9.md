# ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes

### 1. ConfigMaps

ConfigMaps are used to store non-sensitive configuration data, such as database connection URLs, port numbers, or other environment variables. They allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from your container image, making your applications more portable and easier to manage.

### 2. Secrets

Secrets are designed to handle sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, and tokens. Information stored in etcd as secrets is encrypted at rest, ensuring higher security. You can also use custom encryption to enhance data protection.

When creating Secrets, ensure to implement **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** and follow the **principle of least privilege** to limit access to only those who need it.
