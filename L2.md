# Kubernetes Architecture

### Fun Fact:
Kubernetes is abbreviated as **K8s** because the number 8 represents the number of letters between the "K" and the "s" in the word **Kubernetes**.

## Kubernetes Architecture Overview

Kubernetes architecture is divided into two main components:

1. **Control Plane**
2. **Data Plane**

### Control Plane Components:
The control plane is responsible for managing the overall Kubernetes cluster. It consists of:

1. **API Server**: Exposes the Kubernetes environment to external users and handles API requests.
2. **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that stores all cluster data, providing backup for the entire cluster.
3. **Scheduler**: Responsible for scheduling pods and allocating resources within the cluster.
4. **Controller Manager**: Ensures that the desired state of the cluster is maintained. It manages scaling and ensures that **ReplicaSets (RS)** and **Replication Controllers (RC)** are always running.
5. **Cloud Controller Manager (CCM)**: Translates requests from Kubernetes to cloud providers like **EKS** (AWS) or **GKE** (Google Cloud). CCM is not created when running Kubernetes on-premises.

### Data Plane Components:
The data plane is responsible for running the actual workloads (applications). It consists of:

1. **Kubelet**: The agent that runs on each worker node and ensures that containers (pods) are running as expected. Similar to Docker's `dockershim`.
2. **Kube-proxy**: Provides networking and load-balancing functionalities for pods.
3. **Container Runtime**: Manages containerized applications. Kubernetes supports multiple container runtimes like Docker. The container runtime implements Kubernetes' runtime interface to manage containers.

### Simplest Building Block:
- In **Docker**, the simplest unit is a **container**.
- In **Kubernetes**, the simplest unit is a **Pod**.

---

### Networking in Kubernetes:
- **Docker Networking**: Docker uses `docker0` or bridge networking to manage container-to-container communication.
- **Kubernetes Networking**: Kubernetes uses **kube-proxy** to handle networking between pods and ensure communication across the cluster.

---

### Key Components and Their Functions:

- **API Server**: The heart of Kubernetes that handles all incoming API requests and communicates with the external world.
- **Scheduler**: Responsible for scheduling pods and resources to ensure efficient cluster utilization.
- **etcd**: A key-value store that keeps all cluster information and is essential for backups and restoration.
- **Controller Manager**: Manages the cluster's state, autoscaling, and replication through ReplicaSets and Replication Controllers.
- **Cloud Controller Manager (CCM)**: Allows Kubernetes to run on cloud platforms like EKS and GKE by translating cloud-specific requests. Not used in on-premise setups.

This architecture allows Kubernetes to efficiently manage containerized applications, ensuring scalability, resilience, and self-healing capabilities.
