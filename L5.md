# Service

## What Happens When There Is No Service?

When deploying a pod as a deployment, it creates a **ReplicaSet**, and the ReplicaSet spawns the pod(s). We must decide how many requests each pod can handle. However, when new pods are created, each one gets a different IP address. Even though the replicas are up and running, users cannot access the new IPs because they don't know them.

A **Service** acts as a load balancer using **kube-proxy**, allowing users to access pods through the Service, which handles the load balancing.

## How Does a Service Handle Service Discovery?

Service discovery in Kubernetes is done through **labels** and **selectors**. For each pod created, a label is applied to its metadata. The Service uses these labels to locate and route traffic to the appropriate pods.

## What Does a Service Do?

1. **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic evenly across pods.
2. **Service Discovery**: Automatically discovers and routes to the correct pods using labels and selectors.
3. **External Connectivity**: Exposes pods for external access when needed.

## Types of Services

When creating a Service, you can choose between three types:

1. **ClusterIP**:  
   - Default type.
   - The application cannot be accessed from outside the cluster.
   - Provides load balancing and service discovery within the cluster.

2. **NodePort**:  
   - Opens the application to be accessed by any user within the container network.
   - Binds the service to a specific port on each node.

3. **LoadBalancer**:  
   - Exposes the application to the external world.
   - The Cloud Control Manager communicates with an external load balancer (like AWS ELB) to provide a public IP address for the service.

In the case of a LoadBalancer, the service tells users to access the pods using the provided public IP.

## When to Use Each Type of Service

1. **ClusterIP**:  
   Use this type of service when:
   - The application only needs to be accessed from within the cluster.
   - You are setting up internal services, such as databases or microservices, that do not require external exposure.
   - Load balancing and service discovery within the cluster are sufficient.

2. **NodePort**:  
   Choose NodePort when:
   - The application needs to be accessed within the internal network but not by the broader internet.
   - You want to expose the application to users inside the same network or behind a corporate firewall.
   - External load balancing is managed separately, or the setup doesnâ€™t require dynamic public IP assignment.

3. **LoadBalancer**:  
   Opt for LoadBalancer when:
   - The application needs to be exposed to external clients or the internet.
   - You are running the application on a cloud platform that can provide external load balancers, such as AWS, Azure, or GCP.
   - There is a need for automatic public IP assignment for external accessibility.
